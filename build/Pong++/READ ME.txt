I guess there's actually no important reason to read this, you can figure stuff out yourself pretty easily)

Disclaimer: Please donâ€™t expect a better version of Pong, I just had no name ideas.

## How to play
1. Extract the game zip thingy and open Pong++.exe
2. Control the left paddle by moving your mouse
3. Try to get the highest score you can and have fun! :D
4. The game is pretty much endless*. Don't try to outsmart the AI, you'll fail.
   Or, in case you somehow manage to outsmart it, please let me know, I'm really curious of how that happend.

*tehnically not because the speed could get too large, but I suppose that at that point the game would be pretty much impossible for a human.

(Maybe don't change the highscore file inside the assets folder, or do, if you're bored)
