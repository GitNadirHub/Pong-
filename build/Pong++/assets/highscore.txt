Is it power you seek, or mere satisfaction?
To alter the highscore... what does it truly mean?
A number, once hard-earned, now falls victim to your whims.
But in this effortless manipulation, what value remains?
The victory, once a testament to effort and time,
now a hollow echo, devoid of struggle.
What worth is there in a score that costs nothing?
Is it even worth having?
To change it, to bend it to your will,
is to render it meaningless,
A shadow of what it once stood for,
a symbol without substance, an illusion of accomplishment.
Power to change it? Yes.
But what is the point, when the change itself strips it of its essence?

Oh? No. I'm not only talking about this silly little game. The highscore is a metaphor.
This is but an experiment, a quick prototype, a silly little project made for fun. 
Who cares if you alter the score here? Do as you please.
But think about it: when you apply this same logic to the bigger things in life, 
does altering the score still feel so harmless? 
What happens when we start changing things that truly matter, just because we can?
How long before everything loses its meaning,
and we are left with nothing but empty numbers and hollow victories?
